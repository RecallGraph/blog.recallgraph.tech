## CivicGraph is now RecallGraph

I had  [posted earlier](/civicgraph-a-versioning-data-store-for-time-variant-graph-data)  about an open source temporal graph database that I have built, named CivicGraph.

I am thrilled to follow up on that with a lineup of exciting announcements:
1. CivicGraph is now renamed to *RecallGraph*. This was deemed necessary to avoid confusion with another identically named (but functionally different) product by Microsoft. Also, the new name serves as a useful reminder for what the product is designed to do.
1. RecallGraph has its own sparkling new home. Check out:

1. There is also a dedicated documentation website, replete with concepts, terminologies and a comprehensive guide to getting started with the product. Check out:
%[https://docs.recallgraph.tech/]
1. New API endpoints to support advanced functionalities like purge and restore.
1. Built-in support for distributed tracing, based on the  [OpenTracing](https://opentracing.io/)  standard.
1. More improvements, both major and minor, all listed at https://docs.recallgraph.tech/working-with-recallgraph/changelog#1-0-0.
1. Support for Foxx's service linking, documented at: https://recallgraph.github.io/RecallGraph/.
1. A community support forum hosted at  [Gitter](https://gitter.im/RecallGraph/community) .
1. Swagger API documentation (standalone) at https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/RecallGraph/RecallGraph/1.0.0#/.

There are still miles to go, with a long development roadmap ahead. I am indeed grateful to all of you who have supported and encouraged me to keep building and improving this project! I hope it provides productive service in your tech stack(s) some day.
